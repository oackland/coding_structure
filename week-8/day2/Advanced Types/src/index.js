// Type Aliases: Creating our own Type
// Union Types: Can allow a variable to be one of many types (number | string)
// TypeScript Arrow Function
// Literal Types (exact)
// Nullish Coalescing Operator (??): We can fallback to a default value when dealing with null/undefined objects
// Type Assertions: specify a different type than the one inferred by the compiler.
// NOTE: There isn't any type conversion happening under the hood.
// The "unknown" type: We have to narrow down to a specific type before performing any operations
// It is preferred to use "unknown" over "any" bc it forces us to do some type checking
// Creating Classes
// typeof vs instanceof
// private properties and accessing them
// Building a class with parameter properties: Preferred way
// Interfaces vs Types
/* They both establish a shape of an object and can be used interchangeably BUT
Its more conventional to implement Interfaces with Classes AND
Interfaces can also inherit from other Interfaces & Types, while Types cannot.
*/
// interface MUST be an object
